        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            SportMeet is an application designed to address the common problem of finding sports partners or groups 
            to participate in various activities. This is especially relevant for individual or small-team sports such as 
            tennis, basketball, and football. Often, coordinating schedules and booking facilities can be a hassle.
        </p>
        <p>
            The app allows users to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Select their preferred sport and search for public or private fields in their area.</li>
            <li>View available time slots and pricing for private fields.</li>
            <li>Post requests for partners or teammates to form a group.</li>
            <li>Use an in-app chat to coordinate logistics, split costs, and ensure attendance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            SportMeet enhances the experience by combining scheduling functionality with social networking elements,
            allowing users to connect based on their shared sports interests.
