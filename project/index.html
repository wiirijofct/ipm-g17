        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>SportMeet is an application designed to address a common problem faced by sports enthusiasts: the difficulty in finding partners or groups to participate in their preferred sports activities. This issue is particularly common in individual or small-team sports like tennis, basketball, and football, where players often struggle with finding partners and booking suitable venues.</p>
        <p>The app simplifies the process of coordinating sporting activities by allowing users to discover partners based on similar sports interests, book public or private fields, and manage logistics such as splitting costs and ensuring attendance. The application also provides users with the ability to communicate via in-app chat, helping them organize their activities efficiently.</p>
